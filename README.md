### Odysseus DE
Currently very WIP and unstable hobby desktop environment made using Qt Quick.

<sup>Huge thanks to ![Cyber](https://github.com/cyberos) and ![CutefishOS](https://github.com/cutefishos) and their authors for releasing their code with the GPL3 license as I have forked older versions and modified some of their repositories. I have not touched any license headers and I recommend you to go check these projects out and contribute. (I had also contributed to Cyber a few years ago.)<sup>

(**Do not install or use this DE as it is very UNSTABLE as far as I have concluded from testing it in some VM's. It seems to work nearly fine on Linux Mint though.**)
